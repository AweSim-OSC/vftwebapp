    The VFT Sim app is a web interface for simulating the weld process
    utilizing the Ohio Super Computer resources.

    Users of the VFT Sim app will be able to:

    - design weld passes on an uploaded mesh file in our interactive VFTSolid GUI
    - run an analytical thermal analysis on these weld passes using CTSP
    - follow it up with a structural analysis using WARP3D

    Users can then visually analyze the:

    - stresses
    - displacements
    - temperatures

    using Paraview.
